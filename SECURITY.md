## Supported versions

OpenAleph is an open-source project that, by itself, does not come with guaranteed long term support from the community. If you decide to run your own instance of OpenAleph, you are free to [reach out to the community](https://darc.social) with your questions, but you will eventually be responsible to keep your software up to date.

OpenAleph's primary maintainer and developer, the Data and Research Center, offers commercial OpenAleph hosting and full managed services, primarily to journalistic organizations and NGOs. If you want to learn more, [please visit our website](https://dataresearchcenter.org/).

Please refer to our [Support Policy](SUPPORT.md) for more information about supported Aleph versions.
