# Support Policy

_Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral._ ([Kranzberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Kranzberg))

The objective of the OpenAleph project is to provide powerful software primarily to those who do investigative work in the public interest. The [Data and Research Center (DARC)](https://dataresearchcenter.org/) serves as the primary maintainer and developer of the platform.

**Managed Services:**: We develop this technology following the open source model and will continue to release our code to the public. Guaranteed support, including formal service level agreements, is available through [managed services](https://openaleph.org/managed/) provided by DARC.

**Community Support**: If you choose to deploy and run your own OpenAleph instance independently, community support is available via GitHub and our community platform at [darc.social](https://darc.social). Please note that such community support is offered on a best-effort basis with no formal guarantees.

**Supported Versions**: The OpenAleph team usually supports feature versions for 12 months after the first major iteration of that version is released. For example, we support OpenAleph 3.12.x for 12 months after OpenAleph 3.12.0 is released. In the case of critical security vulnerabilities, we'll endeavor to ensure that all currently supported versions are addressed, but we recommend administrators upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible.
