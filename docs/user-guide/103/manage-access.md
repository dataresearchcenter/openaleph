## Default Privacy

When you create a new workspace, it is only visible to you. No one else can see or interact with its contents unless you explicitly invite them.

## Sharing a Workspace

To share a workspace with others:

1. Open the workspace.
2. Click the **Gear icon** in the top right corner and select **Share** from the dropdown menu.

5. Assign a role:
	- **View**: Can see content, but cannot make changes.
	- **Edit**: Can upload documents, edit metadata, contribute to the investigation and add other users.

6. Click **Save changes**.

Invited users will see the workspace listed under their **Investigations** tab.

## Managing Existing Permissions

You can update or remove collaborators at any time by following the same steps listed above. Simply deselect the assigned roles and click **Save changes**.

## Best Practices

- Use the **Editor** role only for active collaborators.
- Periodically review access to investigations for ongoing projects.
- Avoid inviting users who donâ€™t need access to sensitive data.
