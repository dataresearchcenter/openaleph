# Navigating Within Datasets

OpenAleph allows you to search within a specific dataset or investigation workspace. This scoped searching is useful when you want to focus your queries and avoid unrelated results.

## How to Search Within a Dataset

There are two primary ways to restrict your search to a specific dataset:

### 1. From the Dataset Page

</div>

1. Open the dataset from the **Datasets** tab.
2. Use the search bar within the dataset view. This automatically scopes your search to that dataset.

### 2. Using Filters

</div>

On a general search results page:

- Use the **Collection** filter in the left sidebar.
- Select the dataset(s) you want to search within.
- All search terms will now apply only to the selected dataset.

## Extracted `mentions` search

OpenAleph extracts several identifiers from the dataset during ingestion. You can click these identifiers on the overview page to see all entities or files containing them within the dataset.

## Source documents

<div align="center">

</div>

If the dataset contains documents and folders, you can browse these sources by clicking the source documents tab, similar to browsing folder structures on your computer.

Scoped searching helps you stay focused on what matters most in your investigation. Combine it with [Advanced Search](advanced-search.md) techniques to zero in on exactly what you need.
