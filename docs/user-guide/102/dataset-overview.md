# Dataset Overview

Datasets are central to how OpenAleph organizes and structures information. Each dataset represents a collection of documents or structured data that has been uploaded or ingested into the system.

## What is a Dataset?

A dataset in OpenAleph typically contains:

- **Unstructured data**: PDF files, spreadsheets, Word documents, emails, etc.
- **Structured data**: People, companies, addresses, and other entity types extracted from those documents or ingested separately.
- **Metadata**: Information about the source, import date, and context of the dataset.

It's common for datasets to contain both structured and unstructed data.

## Viewing a Dataset

To view a dataset:

1. Navigate to the **Datasets** tab from the top menu.
2. Select a dataset from the list or use the search bar to find one.
3. Click the dataset name to open its detail view.

In the dataset view, youâ€™ll get a good impression of what you're looking at: Number and type of documents contained, a timeline, countries and found in the dataset. OpenAleph will extract further information, if the dataset contains it, like IBAN bank account numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.
